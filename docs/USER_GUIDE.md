## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes! All data is stored locally on your computer in a SQLite database. Nothing is sent to external servers except for news collection APIs (which only send search queries, not your data).

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: The interface works offline, but collecting news requires internet. You can view existing data without internet.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: The application is free! API costs depend on usage:
- Mock APIs: $0 (for testing)
- Google Custom Search: 100 free queries/day, then ~$5/1000 queries
- NewsAPI: Free tier available, paid plans from $449/month

**Q: Can multiple people use it?**
A: Currently single-user. For multi-user, deploy on a server and share the URL.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which database does it use?**
A: SQLite - a lightweight, file-based database included with Python. No separate installation needed!

**Q: Can I import existing clients?**
A: Yes! Create a CSV with columns: name, industry, domain, priority. Then import via scripts/import.py (see Developer Guide).

**Q: How do I update the application?**
A: Download the new version, replace files (keep your .db database), run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

**Q: What if a scan fails?**
A: Check the error message. Common issues:
- Network connection
- API rate limits
- Invalid API keys (if using real APIs)

### Usage Questions

**Q: How many clients can I monitor?**
A: Recommended 50-100 clients for optimal performance. Can handle more, but scans take longer.

**Q: How often should I run scans?**
A: Daily for most use cases. Twice daily for high-priority clients. Weekly for low-priority.

**Q: What if I get too many irrelevant events?**
A: 1) Increase minimum relevance score in settings
   2) Refine client keywords
   3) Use more specific industry categories
   4) Review and flag irrelevant events to improve scoring

**Q: Can I customize event types?**
A: Currently predefined types. Custom types require code changes (see Developer Guide).

**Q: How do I share reports with my team?**
A: 1) Export to CSV and share file
   2) Take screenshots of dashboard
   3) Print to PDF
   4) Deploy on shared server for direct access

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Application won't start**
```bash
# Check Python installation
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Try running directly
streamlit run app.py
```

**Q: Database errors**
```bash
# Backup and reset database
python scripts/reset_database.py

# Or manually delete client_intelligence.db and restart
```

**Q: API errors**
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check rate limits haven't been exceeded
- Test with Mock APIs first
- See logs for detailed error messages

**Q: Slow performance**
- Archive old events
- Reduce number of active clients
- Increase scan frequency (less frequent = faster)
- Check database size (backup and optimize if > 100MB)
