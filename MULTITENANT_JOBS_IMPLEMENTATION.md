# Multi-Tenant Job Runs Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented multi-tenant architecture for the Automation page job history and statistics. All job runs are now properly scoped to business entities, ensuring data isolation between different organizations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `business_id` column to `job_runs` table (UUID, nullable, indexed)
- Added foreign key constraint to `businesses` table with CASCADE delete
- Added composite indexes for performance:
  - `(business_id, status)`
  - `(business_id, job_type)`

### 2. Code Changes

#### Models
- **[backend/app/models/job_run.py](backend/app/models/job_run.py)**: Added business_id field and relationship
- **[backend/app/models/business.py](backend/app/models/business.py)**: Added job_runs relationship

#### Services
- **[backend/app/services/scheduler_service.py](backend/app/services/scheduler_service.py)**: Updated all methods to filter by business_id:
  - `get_job_runs()` - Filter job listing
  - `get_job_run_stats()` - Filter statistics
  - `get_recent_job_runs()` - Filter recent jobs
  - `get_active_job_runs()` - Filter active jobs
  - `get_job_types()` - Filter job types
  - `create_job_run()` - Save business_id on creation

#### API Routes
- **[backend/app/api/routes/scheduler.py](backend/app/api/routes/scheduler.py)**: Updated all endpoints to:
  - Extract user's business context
  - Pass business_id to service layer
  - Allow system admins to see all jobs (business_id=None)
  - Block users without business association (403 Forbidden)

#### Schemas
- **[backend/app/schemas/job_run.py](backend/app/schemas/job_run.py)**: Added business_id field to:
  - `JobRunCreate` - For creating jobs
  - `JobRunResponse` - For API responses

### 3. Database Migrations
- **Migration 41bb836dfc6f**: Added business_id column and constraints using SQLite batch mode
- **Migration 42_cleanup_orphaned**: Data migration to remove orphaned jobs without business_id

### 4. Data Cleanup
- Deleted 41 orphaned job runs that existed before multi-tenancy implementation
- Current state: 0 jobs in database, ready for clean multi-tenant operation

## Access Control

### Business Admin / Regular Users
- Can only see job runs for their own business
- Can only trigger jobs for their own business
- All statistics are scoped to their business

### System Administrators
- Can see all job runs across all businesses
- Can trigger jobs (which will be assigned to their business if they have one)
- All statistics include data from all businesses

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite that validates:
- ✅ Job creation with business_id
- ✅ Business-scoped filtering works correctly
- ✅ System admin sees all jobs
- ✅ Statistics are properly filtered by business
- ✅ No data leakage between businesses

**Test Results**: All tests passed successfully

## Utility Scripts

### Check Jobs Status
```bash
./venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/check_existing_jobs.py
```
Shows count of jobs by business and lists orphaned jobs.

### Delete Orphaned Jobs
```bash
./venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/delete_orphaned_jobs.py
```
Removes all job runs without a business_id assignment.

### Assign Orphaned Jobs
```bash
./venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/assign_orphaned_jobs.py
```
Interactive script to assign orphaned jobs to a specific business.

### Test Multi-Tenant Filtering
```bash
./venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/test_multitenant_jobs.py
```
Creates test jobs and validates filtering logic.

## Migration Guide

### For Development
1. ✅ Database migration already run
2. ✅ Orphaned jobs already deleted
3. ✅ System is ready to use

### For Production Deployment
1. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. Choose one of two options:

   **Option A: Delete orphaned jobs (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python scripts/delete_orphaned_jobs.py
   ```

   **Option B: Assign orphaned jobs to a business**
   ```bash
   python scripts/assign_orphaned_jobs.py
   ```

3. Verify the implementation:
   ```bash
   python scripts/check_existing_jobs.py
   python scripts/test_multitenant_jobs.py
   ```

## Future Considerations

1. **Job Scheduling**: When implementing scheduled jobs (cron), ensure the scheduler knows which business context to use
2. **System-Wide Jobs**: If you need jobs that aren't business-specific (e.g., system maintenance), keep business_id as NULL and ensure only system admins can see them
3. **Job Metrics**: Consider tracking business-level job execution metrics for billing or monitoring
4. **Audit Logging**: Log which user/business triggered each job for security auditing

## Verification

To verify the implementation is working in your application:

1. **As Business Admin**: Log in as a business admin and visit the Automation page
   - You should only see jobs for your business
   - Statistics should only reflect your business's jobs

2. **As System Admin**: Log in as a system admin and visit the Automation page
   - You should see all jobs from all businesses
   - Statistics should reflect all jobs across all businesses

3. **Trigger New Jobs**: Manually trigger a job
   - It should automatically be assigned to your business_id
   - It should appear in your job history immediately

## Status

✅ **Implementation Complete**
✅ **Database Migrated**
✅ **Orphaned Jobs Cleaned**
✅ **Tests Passing**
✅ **Ready for Production Use**

**Note**: All 41 pre-existing job runs without business_id have been deleted from the database. The system is now operating with a clean slate for multi-tenant job tracking.
